The purpose of this document demonstrate some ways to use the data provided by the [Vega datasets](https://github.com/altair-viz/vega_datasets) Python package.

In the [Altair documentation](https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/installation.html), you will see this code used often:

```python 
from vega_datasets import data

cars = data.cars()
```

The convention in the Altair documentation is to use the name `data` to refer to the `data` object in the `vega_datasets` package. This package offers a similar convention:

```{r r-vega-data}
library("altair")

vega_data <- import_vega_data()

cars <- vega_data$cars()
```

Our `vega_data` object has method to list oll its datasets:

```{r list-datasets}
vega_data$list_datasets() %>% head()
```

Each dataset has accessed using a function with a name being an element returned from `list_datasets()`. 

```{r anscome}
library("tibble")

vega_data$anscombe() %>% as_tibble()
```

It is useful to keep in mind that **reticulate** changes the names of the datasets, and presumably, Python objects in general. Where you see a `-` in a name of a Python object, a `_` will be used in the name of the reticulated object in R. For example, in Python: `data.sf-temps()`; in R:

```{r r-sf-temps}
vega_data$sf_temps() %>% as_tibble()
```

Each dataset has some metadata associated:

```{r anscome-description}
vega_data$anscombe$description
```

```{r anscome-is_local}
vega_data$anscombe$is_local
```

```{r}
vega_data$anscombe$references
```

### Vega-datasets object

You can specify a dataset using a URL that points to a dataset, rather than a data frame. The `vega_data` object (assigned using `import_vega_data()`) contains the URLs as well as access to the data frames. 

```{r}
iris_url <- vega_data$iris$url

chart_iris <- 
  alt$Chart(iris_url)$
  encode(
    x = "sepalWidth:Q",
    y = "sepalLength:Q",
    color = "species:N"
  )$
  mark_point()

chart_iris
```

This works in your browser, but not in the RStudio IDE. This is because, for security reasons, the RStudioIDE does not let you refer external URLs that are not on their whitelist (such as YouTube and Vimeo). If you open this up in a browser, it works just fine (as long as you have access to the internet).
