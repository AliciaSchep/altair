The purpose of this document is to try to collect in one place, in a semi-organized fashion, all the fiddly-bits we have found dealing with Python stuff. This includes:

* [**Python installation**](#python): installing Python
* [**Proxies and certificates**](#proxies): letting Python know how to communicate with the world
* [**Python environment**](#python-env)
* [**Altair installation**](#altair): installing Altair into your Python environment
* [**Working with Python objects**](#work-work): how to work with Altair and Vega-datasets objects
* [**Odds and ends**](#odds-ends): weird bits that don't fit anywhere else

There are four foundations upon which this package rests: 

- the [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) Python package, to build chart specifications
- the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) R package, to provide inter-operability with Python
- the [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) JavaScript framework, to render chart specifications into HTML
- the [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) R package, to provide inter-operability with HTML and JavaScript

This article deals with the first two items; the [rendering article](render.html) deals with the other two.

Just to be clear, there is a bit of hassle in setting up Python to use your first R-package that uses reticulate. However, thanks to the folks at RStudio, once you have a Python environment set up in a standard way, each subsequent installation is a single command-line call after `install.packages()`. 

## Python {#python}

To make installation a little easier, we recommend (until its next CRAN release) using the dev version of **reticulate**:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/reticulate")
```

Reticulate offers a number of ways to manange the installation of Python packages into a Python environment, as described in its [*Installing Python Packages*](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html) article.

Here, we amplify some opinions adapted from RStudio. Because [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, we recommend using a Conda Python Installation. I have found using that using Conda for Python 3.6 works well.

Follow the [Conda installation instructions](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html) to suit your particular situation.

TODO: talk about the choice between Conda and Miniconda.

## Proxies and certificates {#proxies}

Before you can *do* anything with your Conda installation, like set up a new environment, you may need to sort out some issues with certificates (and proxies, if you work behind a firewall).
