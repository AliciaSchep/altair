There are four foundations upon which this package rests: 

- the [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) Python package, to build chart specifications
- the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/index.html) R package, to provide inter-operability with Python
- the [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) JavaScript framework, to render chart specifications in an HTML file.
- the [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) R package, to provide inter-operability with HTML and JavaScript

This article deals with the first two items; the [rendering article](render.html) deals with the other two.

The purpose of this document is to try to collect in one place, in a semi-organized fashion, all the fiddly-bits we have found dealing with Python stuff. This includes:

* [**Python installation**](#python): installing Python
* [**Proxies and certificates**](#proxies): letting Python know how to communicate with the world
* [**Python environment**](#python-env): setting up a Python environment with a "standard" name
* [**Altair installation**](#altair): installing Altair into your Python environment
* [**Working with Python objects**](#work-work): how to work with Altair and Vega-datasets objects
* [**Odds and ends**](#odds-ends): weird bits that don't fit anywhere else

Just to be clear, there is a bit of hassle in setting up Python to use your first R-package that uses reticulate.  Getting to this point is the focus of the first three sections of this document.

Thanks to the folks at RStudio, once you have a Python environment set up in a standard way, each subsequent installation is a single command-line call in addition to installing an R package. This is the focus of the [Altair installation](#altair) section, to which you can skip if you already have a working Conda environment called `"r-reticulate"`.

## Python {#python}

We recommend (until its next CRAN release) using the dev version of **reticulate**:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio/reticulate")
```

Reticulate offers a number of ways to manange the installation of Python packages into a Python environment, as described in its [*Installing Python Packages*](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html) article.

Here, we amplify some opinions adapted from RStudio. Because [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, we recommend using a Conda Python installation. I have found using that using Conda for Python 3.6 works well.

Follow the [Conda installation instructions](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html) to suit your particular situation.

TODO: talk about the choice between Conda and Miniconda.

## Proxies and certificates {#proxies}

Before you can *do* anything with your Conda installation, like set up a new Conda environment, you may need to sort out some issues with certificates (and proxies, if you work behind a firewall). There is some information you may need to distribute to different places on your computer. Please note that the angle-brackets , `<>`, are a quoting mechanism for demonstration; they should not be a part of your variables.

- location of a valid certificate file: `</path/to/your/certificate/file.crt>`

Additionally, if you work behind a firewall:

- address of your proxy: `http://<your.proxy.ip.address>:<port>`
- list of addresses for which proxy not to be used: `127.0.0.1,localhost,<other.hostnames.go.here>`

If you do not work behind a firewall, you need only determine the location of a valid certificate file. If you have the **httr** package installed, it will use the certificate file associated with the **openssl** package. You can determine the location of this certificate file by using:

```r
system.file("cacert.pem", package = "openssl")
```

At this point, note this location and move ahead to [**R settings**](#r-settings).

### Working behind a firewall

If you work behind a firewall, it may be a little trickier to find your certificate file. Sylvain Mari√© has put together a field-guide called [develop-behind-proxy](https://smarie.github.io/develop-behind-proxy/), from which we take some inspiration. 

It is possible that your IT department requires that your certificate bundle be modified to include a certificate that your IT department can use to monitor your traffic. In this case, Sylvain offers [some advice](https://smarie.github.io/develop-behind-proxy/know_your_proxy/) to find this certificate bundle, or you can ask your IT department for its location.

If you use a proxy, you have likely modified your `.Renviron` file to set your proxy and no-proxy variables. If you have the **usethis** package installed, it can be very easy to find and open: `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.

If you have your proxy and no-proxy settings, as well as the location of a certificate file, you are ready to move on.

### R settings {#r-settings}

Even though things may already be set up on your computer to use R to access the internet, there are a some things we should set to make it easier for **reticulate** to work with its Python environment. As best as I can tell, when **reticulate** launches its Python, its Python environment inherits environment variables from R. 

Accordingly, we should set some variables in `.Renviron` for this Python environment to use (you may have some of these set already). Add and adapt the following lines as needed. The angle-brackets , `<>`, are a quoting mechanism for demonstration; they should not be a part of your variables.

```
# .Renviron

# path to a certificate file 
SSL_CERT_FILE = "</path/to/your/certificate/file.crt>"
REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE = "${SSL_CERT_FILE}"

# --------------------------------------
# continue if you work behind a firewall

# proxy addresses
https_proxy = "http://<your.proxy.ip.address>:<port>"
http_proxy = "${https_proxy}" 

HTTPS_PROXY = "${https_proxy}"
HTTP_PROXY = "${http_proxy}"

# addresses for which proxy is not to be used
no_proxy = "127.0.0.1,localhost,<other.hostnames.go.here>"
```

Although you may not yet have set up a Conda environment, this may be a good time to tell **reticulate** which Python environment to use. For use with **reticulate**, RStudio [recommend] using a Python environment called `"r-reticulate"`. If you are using Conda, we recommend that you add this line to your `.Rprofile` (`usethis::edit_r_profile()` can be useful). 

```
# .Rprofile
reticulate::use_condaenv("r-reticulate")
```

Of course, you should restart your R session to let your new settings take effect.

### System settings

To diagnose problems, it can be useful to access Python from your command-line. In this case, Python will need to get its environment variables from the system itself. How to set these, as you can imagine, depends on your system.

#### MacOS

The file `~/.bash_profile` acts in a similar way as `.Renviron`, but the syntax is just a little different. Using your favorite text editor, find and edit your `.bash_profile`, adding and adapting these lines as needed. The angle-brackets , `<>`, are a quoting mechanism for demonstration; they should not be a part of your variables.

```
# MacOS .bash_profile

# path to a certificate file 
export SSL_CERT_FILE=</path/to/your/certificate/file.crt>
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=${SSL_CERT_FILE}

# --------------------------------------
# continue if you work behind a firewall

# specifies addresses for which proxy is not to be used
export NO_PROXY="127.0.0.1,localhost,<other.hostnames.go.here>"

# specifies the proxy addresses
export https_proxy=http://<your.proxy.ip.address>:<port>
export http_proxy=${https_proxy}

export HTTPS_PROXY=${https_proxy}
export HTTP_PROXY=${http_proxy}
```

A new terminal window will have access to these settings.

#### Windows

In Windows, the customary way to set or change environment variables is to use `Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System` then "Advanced System Settings" and "Environment Variables". This may vary according to your version of Windows. I would set each of these variables to values, adapting these lines as needed. The angle-brackets , `<>`, are a quoting mechanism for demonstration; they should not be a part of your variables.

```
# Windows environment variables
# 
# Varaible : Value

SSL_CERT_FILE : </path/to/your/certificate/file.crt>
REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE: </path/to/your/certificate/file.crt>

# --------------------------------------
# continue if you work behind a firewall

NO_PROXY : 127.0.0.1,localhost,<other.hostnames.go.here>

HTTP_PROXY : http://<your.proxy.ip.address>:<port>
HTTPS_PROXY : http://<your.proxy.ip.address>:<port>
```

Close out of your system-settings window and open an "Anaconda prompt". If all is well, you will be able to update your Conda installation:

```
# Anaconda prompt

conda update conda
```

## Python environment {#python-env}

Once you have Conda installed, and you are able to successfully update it from the Conda prompt (`conda update conda`), create a Conda environment called `"r-reticulate"`. 

One way to do this is from an R command-prompt:

```r
reticulate::conda_create("r-reticulate")
```

This should "just work".
