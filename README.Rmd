# altair

The goal of altair is to provide an interface to the [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) Python package, which builds Vega-Lite visualizations. This is a short term solution - I am a big fan of the native R interface to build Vega-Lite visualizations that Bob Rudis (@hrbrmstr) and coworkers are building with the [vegalite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite) package.

## Development plan

For the foreseeable future, this package is going to be very rough. At the moment, you are able to muck around with Vega-Lite 2.0. This means:

1. You can create charts by accessing the Python **Altair** API using **reticulate**.
1. You can display charts using the `vegalite()` htmlwidget.

There's really not much beyond that. Here's what I have in mind for the near future:

1. Tooltips.
1. A proper installation procedure for the Altair Python package, a function like `install_altair()`.

In the longer-term future it may be interesting to provide a proper R interface to the Python API. I have no idea what that looks like, although we might take some inspiration from the [keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/) package.

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/altair")
```
