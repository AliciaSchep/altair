# altair

The goal of altair is to provide an interface to the Altair python package, which builds Vega-Lite visualizations. This is a short term solution - I am a big fan of the native R interface to build Vega-Lite visualizations that Bob Rudis and coworkers are building with their [vegalite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite) package.

## Development plan

For the foreseeable future, this package is going to be very rough. The immediate goal is to be able to muck around with Vega-Lite 2.0. This means:

1. Building the bridge to Python and Altair.
1. Wrapping up outputs as htmlwidgets.

## Installation

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/altair")
```

## Acknowledgements

This package does not contribute much new; it rests on these foundations:

- [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io)
- [Reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulat)
- [Vega-Lite](<https://vega.github.io/vega-lite)
- [D3](https://d3js.org)
- [vegalite R ðŸ“¦]
